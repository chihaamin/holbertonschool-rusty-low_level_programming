#### *This repository is a companion to the holbertonschool-low_level_programming C projects, where I'm recreating the same exercises and concepts in Rust.*

## Overview

##### As a Holberton School student learning C through low-level programming exercises, this parallel repository serves to:
###### > Reinforce my understanding of low-level concepts by implementing them in Rust
###### > Learn Rust's memory safety features while working with low-level constructs
###### > Build a portfolio demonstrating both C and Rust skills

## Structure

##### The repository mirrors the structure of the original C projects, with directories corresponding to each C project/concept. Each directory contains:

###### > Rust implementations of the C exercises.
###### > Any necessary additional Rust-specific documentation.
###### > Comparative notes between the C and Rust approaches.
###### > Each project will contain **build** script.
###### > Concept files are in the **/src**.
###### > All the files names in the C project and the Rust project are the same.
